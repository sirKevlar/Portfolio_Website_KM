                <p class="nc-projects-text">Working in the Northcoders internal development department is similar to many other dev teams who engage in agile development practices and included: Regular stand-ups with kanban, a ticket and git based development management cycle and participation in other SCRUM ceremonies such as planning and retros.</p>

                <p class="nc-projects-text">Working within the atomic design paradigm, the Northcoders React Component Library is a large library of components created within Storybook using Tailwind and tested using React Testing Library. I was responsible for creating a number of the animations as well as several buttons, form inputs and other form related components.</p>

                <p class="nc-projects-text">The Learner Management System is the biggest and boldest internal development project I was part of at Northcoders. It aims to manage the complete student journey from first interest through to graduation and beyond. Using Prisma and tRPC, I updated the table structure through Prisma migrations, all rigorously tested.</p>

Designed from the floor up to be a landing spot for students to learn about coding and test their knowledge. I was involved in designing and writing the test suite behind many of the student interactive challenges.</p>

                <p class="nc-projects-text">A single command in Slack will hook into Northcoders' Learner Management System and procedurally generate graduation certificates, with social links and email to all valid graduates. I was involved with this project during it's genesis and spiked out much of the tech which eventually made it into the stack.</p>

                <p class="nc-projects-text">A key part of the Northcoders course is collaborative work. This means the students and tutors engage in paired programming the majority of the time. A pairing generator was my firs development project at Northcoders. I saw the project from spiking through to the release of the first and second versions.</p>
