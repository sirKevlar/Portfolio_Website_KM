                <span class="text-highlight">Wow!</span> If you are here, you are either really interested in my work or you have a slight problem with compulsive reading! Don't worry, apparently about 20% of the populous shares your issue. <span class="text-highlight">The following is a brief biography</span>, with some unpublishable bits omitted. There might even be some shiny photos for the non-compulsive readers amongst you.

                I was encouraged to perform on stage from a very young age, largely due to my strong reading ability and lack of inhibition. <span class="text-highlight">Always singing, dancing or acting</span>, I was taking leading roles in productions by the time I was 8. I was also <span class="text-highlight">encouraged to play musical instruments</span>, which I did with varying degrees of success. I had music tuition from the age of 7, but didn't really take it seriously until I was about 12, when I started playing in bands.
            </p>
            <p> 
            Throughout my school years I was involved in numerous productions, both in and out of school, and was a member of several bands, one of which performed at the national festival of music for youth. It was a natural progression when I headed to university to study for a <span class="text-highlight">performance degree</span>.

                After university I became interested in <span class="text-highlight">music production</span> and started learning the dark arts of Cubase and Ableton. As with many aspiring artists, I had a variety of careers or day jobs to support my art projects...

                My first job was as an <span class="text-highlight">office administrator</span>, a great entry-level role to begin my career, but it was always going to be a stepping stone into something more interesting. I moved into sales for a few years, which was more challenging, but high pressure <span class="text-highlight">sales positions</span> were clearly not for me and it was time for a career re-think.
            </p>
            <p>
                I took a few months off to travel and ended up in a <span class="text-highlight">factory job</span> in the nouth of England, fabricating rooves. It was hard work, but it paid well and I was able to save some money for my next adventure. After a year or so I got a job as a <span class="text-highlight">conservatory fitter</span>, which was even harder work, but better paid. The work was extremely physically demanding and I wanted to find a trade which more suited my diminutive stature.
            </p>
            <p>
                While fitting rooves I got the opportunity to retrain as a <span class="text-highlight">painter and decorator</span>, a job which requires an eye for detail and more than a little artistic flair. I was lucky enough to work on a number of National Trust properties in the Cotswolds and Oxfordshire, which was a great experience, but I was still not satisfied. I wanted to work in the creative industries, so I took a leap of faith and <span class="text-highlight">moved to Manchester to pursue my music career</span>.

                I moved into a flat in Manchester and got a job working in a bar, hoping to meet other musicians and play in more bands. Whilst working as serving staff I ended up getting some kitchen experience which lead to me working as a <span class="text-highlight">chef</span> for a couple of years. These jobs served their purpose, as I made many <span class="text-highlight">music contacts in Manchester</span>, but I literally couldn't stand the heat, so I had to get out of the kitchen.

                Having made plenty of music contacts and beginning to get paid work as an artist gave me the confidence to become a full time musician, during which time I <span class="text-highlight">toured Europe 4 times</span>. It was a great time and to an extent, we actually lived the dream. It is however always challenging as a touring musician to manage finances. At this point some of my music colleagues with teaching experience, suggested becoming a music tutor. I taught privately for a few years and then began doing <span class="text-highlight">music workshops</span>, which lead to me teaching in both primary and high school. Fast forward a few years and I had a <span class="text-highlight">successful music tutoring company</span>, providing outsourced music lessons to primary schools and was settled (ish); I wasn't exactly happy in the job, but at least it was secure, until the outbreak of Covid19 in 2020. The pandemic put a stop to all music lessons and I was forced to close my business. I had to find a new career, so I decided to retrain.

                I had always been interested in technology and had dabbled with coding in the past, but never really taken it seriously. <span class="text-highlight">Coding kind of runs in the blood:</span> My father has been a developer since the late 60s. My mother and both siblings are also employed in the tech world. I had no industry experience in coding prior to 2021, but I have been using a PC since my dad brought a BBC computer with a whopping 32kb onboard home in the mid 80s. I later experimented with early Macs, which largely meant just clicking on everything and seeing what it did, and was using Windows PCs from an early version (can't remember which).
            </p>
            <p>    
                I took the plunge and retrained in early 2021 and after graduating from a 14 week <span class="text-highlight">full-stack developer boot camp with Northcoders</span>, I scored a job as part of their teaching and mentoring team. I leant heavily on my teaching experience and my positive experience on the course, and found myself <span class="text-highlight">promoted to software engineer and seminar lead after 3 months</span>,  I have been leading a small seminar team responsible for remotely delivering the full course curriculum to a group of 30+ students on a 13 week rotation for well over a year and have had several secondments to the <span class="text-highlight">Northcoders internal development department.</span>
