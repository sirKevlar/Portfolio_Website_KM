        <p><a id="introHighlit">Wow!</a> If you are here, you are either really interested in my work or you have a slight problem with compulsive reading
        (don't worry, aparently about 20% of the populus shares your issue). <a id="introHighlit">The following is a breif history of everything</a> I
        ever did (well, the publishable bits). In some cases there may even be some shiny photos for those non-compulsive readers
        amongst you.<br><br>
        This is a story is a story of career transition <a id="introHighlit">from musician/music teacher to junior software developer</a> in less than a 
        year (<a id="introHighlit">Coda 2 Coder</a> if you like).<br><br>
        First of all a little about me (naturally)...<br><br>
        From a very young age I remember hearing the same thing said about me: <a id="introHighlit">"That boy should be on stage"</a>, an opinion which 
        mirrored my desires, it was set in stone from about the age of 5.<br><br>
        Fast forward 13 years and I was headed to university for a <a id="introHighlit"></a>performance degree, the years in between littered with countless 
        stage performances, several <a id="introHighlit">school bands</a> and one offer of a record contract (which never materialised).<br><br>

        <div class="caption">School band 1993 first and only record contract offer</div>
        <br><br>
        After university I became interested in <a id="introHighlit">music production</a> and started learning the dark arts. As with many aspiring artists, 
        I had a variety of careers or day jobs to support my art projects...<br><br>

        <br><br>
        I began as a <a id="introHighlit">desk top publisher</a>, but that job soon morphed into an administrators position, which I found uninspiring. 
        I moved into sales for a few years, which was marginally more interesting, but the stress was too much for me. Time for 
        my first total switch...<br><br>
        I walked around my local area in a suit with a CV and ended up building rooves in a window factory. The job required 
        someone with <a id="introHighlit">maths skill</a>, was interesting and was quite well paid for factory work. After a few years of fabricating rooves, 
        I moved into fitting them, which was better pay but brutal on the body. While fitting rooves I got the opportunity to retrain 
        as a <a id="introHighlit">painter and decorator</a>, so I did that for a while as it was easier on the body. Work was hard to come by in the north though 
        and commuting down south took its toll. Time for switch #2...<br><br>

        <br><br>
        I moved into a cheap flat in Manchester and got a job working in a bar, hoping to meet other musicians and play in more bands. 
        Whilst working as serving staff I ended up getting some kitchen experience which lead to me working as a chef for several years. 
        These jobs served their purpose, as I made many <a id="introHighlit">music contacts in Manchester</a>, but I couldn't stand the heat (angry chef), so I 
        had to get out of the kitchen. Time for switch #3...<br><br>
        <img src="Phoenix3.jpg" id="phoenixFestival" class="center">
        <div class="caption">Phoenix Festival 2015</div>
        <br><br>
        Having made plenty of music contacts and beginning to get paid work as an artist gave me the confidence to become a full time 
        musician, during which time I <a id="introHighlit">toured Europe 4 times</a>. It was a great time and to an extent, we actually lived the dream. I was 
        however becoming thin thanks to lack of finances! At this point some of my music colleagues suggested becoming a music tutor. 
        I taught privately for a few years and then began doing <a id="introHighlit">music workshops</a>, which lead to me teaching in both primary and high 
        school. Fast forward a few more years and I had a <a id="introHighlit">successful music tutor company</a>, providing outsourced music lessons to primary 
        schools and was settled (ish); I wasn't exactly happy in the job, but at least it was secure. Then COVID decimated my business. 
        Time for switch #4...<br><br>

        That's where we stand as I write this introduction. Starting another career again, but this time with many more responsibilities 
        (children etc). At least I have some finances available to retrain, unlike countless others. Why coding you may ask; well to be 
        honest it <a id="introHighlit">ind of runs in the blood</a>: My father has been a developer since the late 60s. I definitely have no real experience in 
        developing, but I have been using a PC since my dad brought a BBC home in the mid 80s. I later experimented with early Apple Macs, 
        which largely meant just clicking on everything and seeing what it did, and was using Windows PCs from an early version (can't 
        remember which). I have <a id="introHighlit">built a few PCs</a> and would describe myself as having a good understanding of PCs and computer applications, 
        but consider myself to be a well educated beginner in coding at best. As well as the genetic reasons for training as a developer, 
        there are also obviously a number of practical reasons in the post COVID world. I want a career which is more secure in this new 
        and changing world and I need to be able to work from home if necessary.
