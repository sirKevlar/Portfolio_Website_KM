                I'm Kev, that's me in the picture above. I live near Manchester and was a <span class="text-highlight">Software Engineer & Seminar Lead for Northcoders</span> specializing in <span class="text-highlight">React, JavaScript, Typescript, CSS & HTML</span>. I helped develop and maintain many of Northcoders' internal and external platforms using <span class="text-highlight">Storybook, Figma, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Prisma, tRPC, Jest, Supertest & React Testing Library.</span> I have been involved in many Northcoders development projects, both internal and external, and have <span class="text-highlight">produced numerous websites</span> for musicians, bands and music related organisations.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the last 15 years I have also: <span class="text-highlight">Released an album</span>, produced albums for many artists, <span class="text-highlight">set up a record label</span>, managed and performed on <span class="text-highlight">four European tours</span>, tutored <span class="text-highlight">hundreds of music students</span> (drums, percussion, guitar, ukulele, singing) and set up a successful <span class="text-highlight">business outsourcing music tutoring</span> in primary schools, which continued to grow year upon year until the COVID19 pandemic. <span class="text-highlight">I retrained as a software developer in 2021 and got a job working for the UK's #1 software development bootcamp, Northcoders</span> and most importantly I became <span class="text-highlight">father to two amazing girls: Isla and Alys</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                As is the case with many music industry professionals, I've had a number of 'day jobs', these include: 
            </p>
            <h2 id="animated-footer">Wedding singer extraordinaire...</h2>
            <p>
                Nearly <span class="text-highlight">10 years</span> working with <span class="text-highlight">unbelievably talented children</span> and <span class="text-highlight">dedicated staff</span> in primary and high schools <span class="text-highlight">all around NW England</span>, taught me how to <span class="text-highlight">communicate and teach</span> on a multitude of levels.</p>
            <p>
                These days music is my hobby and my other passions: <span class="text-highlight">computer software and design</span> drive my career forward. I have continued to work in education, but this time with adults, teaching software development remotely and I am looking forward to seeing what the next chapter brings. <span class="text-highlight">Check the links below</span> if you want to get in contact.
