        I'm Kev, that's me in the picture above (nice hair pic eh)? I am a frontend developer specializing in JS and CSS and I live near Manchester. 
        I am a student at Northcoders and have produced numerous websites for musicians, bands and music related organisations.
        In the last 10 years I have: Released an album, produced albums for many artists, set up a record label (which susequently failed),
        arranged, managed and performed on four European tours, tutored hundreds of music students (drums, percussion, guitar, ukulele, recorder, singing),
        set up a successful business outsourcing music tutoring in primary schools (successful PRE COVID19, that is) and most importantly
        I became father to two amazing girls: Isla and Alys.
